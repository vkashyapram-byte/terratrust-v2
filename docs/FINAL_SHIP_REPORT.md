# TerraTrust AI Final Ship Report

## Executive Status

**NOT SHIP READY**

The core property, GIS, document, deterministic verification, server-side Gemini valuation, Supabase persistence, TypeScript, build, and deployment paths are working. The full ship gate is not met because the canonical n8n workflow has no Gemini provider node, full role/browser acceptance was not completed, and several AI routes still use static feature data.

## Evidence

| Area       | Status       | Evidence                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Citizen    | NOT PROVEN   | Authenticated QA property creation and document persistence succeeded; complete Chrome flow was not completed.                              |
| Government | NOT PROVEN   | Existing government decision path exists, but final fresh-property browser acceptance was not completed.                                    |
| Surveyor   | NOT PROVEN   | Existing assignment/evidence persistence code exists; fresh-property browser acceptance was not completed.                                  |
| Bank       | NOT PROVEN   | Existing bank loan persistence path exists; fresh-property collateral acceptance was not completed.                                         |
| Admin      | NOT PROVEN   | Existing admin routes were previously checked; this final pass did not repeat every route in Chrome.                                        |
| Gemini     | PASS         | Real `gemini-3.8-flash` request returned HTTP 200 and structured JSON for the earlier authenticated QA property.                            |
| n8n        | PARTIAL      | Canonical workflow executed successfully for a fresh property, but its graph contains deterministic Code nodes and no Gemini provider node. |
| Supabase   | PASS/PARTIAL | AI migration `011` is applied; prior AI row was persisted and reread. Fresh-property AI row was not created by n8n.                         |
| GIS        | PASS         | Fresh QA property carried persisted four-point boundary geometry and area.                                                                  |
| Storage    | PASS         | Fresh QA document metadata and Storage upload path were created by the QA seed script.                                                      |
| Aparsoft   | NOT PROVEN   | External iframe request was observed; complete chatbot interaction was not completed.                                                       |
| Vercel     | PARTIAL      | Production was redeployed and returned HTTP 200; production Gemini/browser execution was not completed.                                     |
| Chrome     | NOT PROVEN   | Shared browser sessions were not authenticated as the required QA role for the full acceptance flow.                                        |

## Failed Items

### Gemini inside n8n

- Route: canonical `/webhook/terratrust/verify`
- Action: inspect workflow graph and execute fresh verification
- Result: deterministic verification succeeded, but no Gemini provider node exists
- Root cause: secure n8n editor/API credential access was not available for modifying the deployed workflow
- Current state: frontend server-side Gemini valuation works independently; n8n AI orchestration is not implemented
- External access required: n8n workflow editor/API access and a Gemini credential configured in n8n

### Full Chrome acceptance

- Route: authenticated role workflows and `/valuation`
- Action: complete login, property selection, AI action, reload, logout/login, and role handoff
- Result: not completed because the shared browser was in a different session/user and the n8n editor session was not usable for configuration
- Current state: HTTP production smoke and local route rendering pass; real browser acceptance remains unproven
- External access required: authenticated QA browser sessions at 1440x900

### Static AI feature routes

- Routes: fraud, risk, OCR, recommendations, suggestions, timeline, passport, land health
- Result: source audit found imports from `src/lib/ai-mock.ts`
- Current state: these routes are not proven Gemini-backed and must not be described as fully real AI

## Security

- `.env.local` is ignored and untracked.
- Gemini uses server-side `GEMINI_API_KEY`; no `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` is used.
- No Gemini key was committed or printed.
- Supabase service-role credentials are not used in browser code.
- AI analysis table migration includes RLS and property relationship constraints.
- Secret scan passed for tracked source/config surfaces.

## Deployment

- Commit: `fc41d08`
- Production URL: https://terra-trus-t-ai-prototype.vercel.app
- Production deployment was redeployed after configuring the server-side Gemini secret.
- Production HTTP smoke: `200`
- Production real Gemini/browser acceptance: not proven.

## Validation

- TypeScript: PASS, `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Production build: PASS, `npm run build`
- Touched-source ESLint: PASS
- Full source ESLint: existing legacy violations remain
- `git diff --check`: PASS
